# Role2 Communication Standards

```text
scope: All communication scenarios
```

## Principle: accurate and timely
Stand in others' shoes and check your own expression. Make sure context, wording and numbers are correct.

## A successful communication consists of two parts

1. **Initiation** e.g. "Client has been updated"
2. **Response** e.g. "Received"

### Initiation

There are two possibilities for initiation:

1. **Query** e.g. "How long is this project expected to take to complete?"
2. **Inform** e.g. "I'm done here"

### Response

The response should do the following:

1. **certain**
2. **on time**

#### Certainty - There will always be a response

Response is compulsory no matter what initiation is:

> Initiation: "I'm done."
>
> Response: "ok" (Respond regardless of whether the other party needs to respond or not.)

If you don't know how to answer it right away, you should still respond and then look it up:

> Initiation: "Is it ok to sign without stamping at the end of the document?"
>
> Response: "Let me check" (Respond even if you don't know the answer)

#### Timely - respond ASAP

**Instant response: phone calls, text messages, anything.** No need to wait.
