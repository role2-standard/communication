scope: All communication scenarios
```

## A successful communication consists of two parts

1. **Initiation** e.g. "Client has been updated"
2. **Response** e.g. "Received"

### Initiation

There are two possibilities for initiation:

1. **Query** e.g. "How long is this project expected to take to complete?"
2. **Inform** e.g. "I'm done here"

### Response

The response should do the following:

1. **certain**
2. **on time**
